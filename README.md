# Vulkan Engine
This project is based on the https://vkguide.dev/ tutorial, but I plan to significantly expand functionality and implemented some computer graphics techniques 
like mesh shaders, ray-tracing, IBL and other. For now I've implemented basic PBR, three light casters (spot, point and directional) with shadow mapping and
order independent transparency. Implementing render graph, clustered deferred rendering, runtime shader compilation and a basic asset manager are goals for the near future.
